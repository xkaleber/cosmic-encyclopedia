Hello, future software developer! In this exercise, we will practice routing in React by using `React Router v6` to navigate between the many wonders of space. 🤩

Your primary goal is to develop a React application that showcases various celestial objects. Users will navigate through different "pages" dedicated to planets, stars, nebulae, and galaxies, learning fascinating facts about each.

## Tasks 📋

- Initialize your React application and install React Router v6 (Hint: `npm install react-router-dom`).
- Implement the `NavBar` component by creating links that allow users to navigate to different categories of celestial objects (e.g., Planets, Stars, Galaxies).
- Implement a `HomePage` component that introduces users to the Cosmic Encyclopedia.
- Develop dynamic `ContentPage` routes. Each object will have its own URL and content, loaded based on an ID.
- Implement the `NavigateBackButton` to allow users to return to the previous page, enhancing your application's navigational experience.
- Create a dataset of celestial objects with IDs, titles, and content to be displayed on their respective pages.

Happy coding!
